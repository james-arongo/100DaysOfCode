# 100 Days of Code: Project Repository
This repository serves as the centralized archive for the 100 Days of Code initiative. It functions as a monorepo, encompassing the various curricula, programming languages, and technological frameworks explored throughout the duration of this undertaking.
The primary objective of this project is to adhere to a rigorous schedule of daily software development practice, thereby fostering consistent skill acquisition and technical proficiency.

## Repository Architecture
The repository is organized into distinct directories, each designated for a specific pedagogical track or programming language.
| Directory | Focus | Status |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| python | Python Programming | 🟢 Active |

## Operational Guidelines
This initiative adheres to the following rules:
1. **Daily Engagement:** Engage in programming activities for a minimum duration of one hour daily.
2. **Progress Logging:** Daily progress, concepts learned, and project outcomes shall be documented within the repository's internal milestone logs to ensure consistent tracking of growth.
3. **Version Control:** Code modifications must be committed and pushed to this repository on a daily basis to ensure continuous integration of new concepts.
