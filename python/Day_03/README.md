# Day 3: Control Flow and Logical OPerators

## Concepts Learned
* **Conditional Statements:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to run specific blocks of code based on certain conditions.
* **Comparison Operators:** Comparing values to return a boolean (`True` or `False`) using symbols like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=`.
* **Modulo Operator:** Using the `%` symbol to find the remainder of a division (commonly used to check for even or odd numbers).
* **Nested Statements:** Placing `if` / `else` statements inside other `if` / `else` statements to handle complex logic.
* **Logical Operators:** Combining multiple conditions into a single check using `and`, `or`, and `not`.


## Today's Project: Treasure Island
**Description:**
A text-based adventure game where the player navigates through a mysterious island to find a treasure. The player must make a series of choices (Left or Right? Swim or Wait?) that determine whether he or she survives or get "Game Over."

### Features
* **Control Flow:** The game utilizes a "flowchart" logic structure.
* **Nested Logic:** Uses `if` statements inside other `if` statements to create branching storylines.
* **Case Insensitivity:** Handles user input (like "left", "Left", or "LEFT") using the `.lower()` function to prevent errors.
